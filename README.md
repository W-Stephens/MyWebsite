# My Personal Website
This is the code used for my personal website. As is this code will not work due to the dbinfo.ini.php being in the wrong location and not being filled in. It should be up a directory so that it is inaccessible to anyone trying to access it. 

Information on how I have set up and hosted the website is available at https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/uk_faculty_connection/2017/07/19/how-to-set-up-and-host-your-own-website-with-an-sql-server-on-azure-for-students/
