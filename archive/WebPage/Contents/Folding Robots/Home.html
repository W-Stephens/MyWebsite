                <p>Due to further advances in robotics, engineers have now been able to program a robot to do a menial household
                    chore like folding clothes. It works by the robot being able
                    to work out the geometry of the article, and computing
                    various algorithms which will give it a sequence of movements
                    which, when carried out, will result in a folded item.</p>
                <p>There are folding methods that are definitely more popular
                    than others, however, many different techniques such as
                    the Japanese method, were also researched and taken into
                    mind when working out what the ideal way of folding would
                    be. Due to the physical complications, it was preferable to
                    look at the problem from a geometric point of view when
                    defining a cloth model. From the geometry of the article,
                    the number of grippers required is worked out. </p>
                <p>Of course some restrictions and assumptions had to be
                    made for the job to be feasible. Some part of the material
                    has to be in contact with the flat surface at all times.
                    Furthermore, after it grips, it raises the material such that
                    it becomes perpendicular with the surface. The motion of the robot
                    is restricted in this way, and uses gravity to reduce the number of grippers required.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The cloth has infinite flexibility. There is no energy contribution from bending.</li>
                    <li>The cloth is non-stretchable. No geodesic path lengths can be increased.</li>
                    <li>The cloth has infinite friction with the surface on which it lies and with itself.</li>
                    <li>The cloth has zero thickness.</li>
                    <li>The cloth is subject to gravity.</li>
                    <li>The cloth has no dynamics.(1)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A further assumption regarding the movement of the cloth
                    was that, when one or more grippers release the cloth,
                    there will be no upward movement of the cloth anywhere
                    due to gravity and the internal forces of the cloth. This is called the
                    downward tendency assumption.(2)</p>
                <p>For a flat, simple rectangular-shaped item, like a towel, the
                    process is more straightforward. The robot can identify the object in
                    question by using background segmentation. This means the robot
                    just sees the space that the object is occupying. The rest, as far as
                    the robot is concerned, is not there. Next, it is easy for the robot to
                    work out where the corners of the towel are, and so it uses the
                    grippers to pick them up and begin folding in half repeatedly until the towel
                    is at the required size.(3)</p>
                <p>The process is much more difficult with items such as T-shirts. The
                    grippers must be gripping the cloth in such a way as to make the
                    vertical section immobilised. This is to ensure the deterministic behaviour
                    of the cloth. The points on the flat surface are already immobilised as
                    they cannot move due to both friction and downward-tendency assumption.
                    This means we do not need to grasp them at these points. The aim is to
                    make all parts of the cloth immobilised. We do this using the theorem:</p>
                <p><i>In our material model, a vertically hanging cloth polygon is immobilised when every convex vertex of the cloth at which the negative gravity vector does not point into the cloth polygon is fixed (i.e. be held by a gripper or be part of the baseline).</i></p>
                <p>Now we can remove all the immobilised points and use the theorem again on
                    the remainder of the cloth. It recurses on the convex vertices of the new polygon.
                    These vertices were non-convex in the original cloth.(4)</p>
                <p>The way the robot folds the material is by a series of g-folds. A g-fold is
                    a when you define a line whose endpoints are on the boundary of the
                    cloth. Then you fold the left side of the line over the line until it lies
                    horizontally on top of the other part whilst maintaining this property:
                    At all times during a folding procedure, every part of the cloth is either horizontal or vertical, and the grippers hold points on the vertical part such that it is immobilised.(5)</p>
                <p>Once the exact motion of the grippers has been programmed, we can
                    then start folding items such as shirts or trousers. When looking at a new
                    article of clothing, a human clicks on the vertices of the item. Then, using
                    a GUI, the user can click to specify the sequence of g-folds the robot can
                    perform with the grippers. This is done one fold at a time.</p>
                <p>If a specified fold is not achievable, then the user is able to call a folding
                    primitive. The sequence of folds for the primitives are parametrised
                    on features including scaling, rotation and side lengths. For the purposes
                    of keeping experiments consistent, these primitives are used.</p>
                <p>The following results from UC Berkeley show various success rates and
                    completion times for folding some different articles of clothing.(4)</p>
