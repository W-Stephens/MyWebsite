                <p>The significance of Home Robotics stems from our need and desire to simplify our life. With the aid of home robotics, mundane tasks such as vacuuming, doing laundry and many others can be done for us autonomously. According to the United States Bureau of Labour Statistics, on the average day, 85% of women, and 67% of men will spend time doing housework, and spend an average of 2.6 hours, and 2.1 hours respectively(1). All that time is better spent on doing things we truly enjoy, and let the robots take away the boring parts of daily life.</p>
                <p>Weâ€™ve always turned to technological advancements when we wish to better our lives, home robotics is the next step in this technological evolution. Inventions such as lawn mowers, washing machines, or even the wheel were designed to simplify our lives. The difference between past inventions and home robotics is that rather than making a task easier to do, it does the task for you.</p>
                <p>Furthermore, home robotics can help take care of the disabled, and elderlies who are incapable of doing certain housework. They could also be there to provide company to those who have no one, for example the Wakamaru, a Japanese designed robot capable of communicating with humans, as well as recognize faces, and in the event of an intruder (unrecognized face), notify the owner.</p>
