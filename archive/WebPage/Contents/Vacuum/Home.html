                    When it comes to robot vacuum cleaners there are two main approaches. Cheaper vacuum cleaners often operate randomly with little real world sensing in operation, while more sophisticated machines use camera vision to map the real world and navigate the room far more precisely.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of commercially available robot vacuum cleaners won’t actually map the room, but instead will only recognise the size of the room and then travel the room in a nearly random fashion. Because there are a lot of these random cleaning robots available, I will be looking at the early Roomba models. The Roomba is fitted with a series of sensors including infrared emitter/receiver, front-mounted bump sensor, and both cliff and wall sensors.(1,2)⁠ The Roomba begins its cleaning procedure by first calculating the size of the room by timing how long it takes to reflect an infrared signal off the walls of the room. It allows the Roomba to calculate how long to clean the room for.(2)⁠ Roombas have a few different cleaning methods, though the original Roombas were often hit and miss due to not relying on any virtual mapping of the room and would mostly work at random, spiraling outward until an object is hit and then cleaning the perimeter of the object before moving off randomly again. Over a long period of time this method of cleaning generally does a complete job, but it takes a lot longer than if we were to use visual information for the robot to calculate where it is and where it needs to go and efficiently clean the room.(2,3)

                <p>
                    The original Roombas only used simple real world sensing such as infrared sensors to calculate the size of the room and to prevent the Roomba from falling down steep drops. Another use of infrared sensors in the Roomba is to allow it to follow along walls and objects without bumping into it. The Roomba is able to detect it has hit an object by using a bumper, which when impacted, activates a mechanical switch to tell the Roomba it has interacted with an object.(2,3)
                </p>⁠
                <p>
                    Roombas use very little in terms of visual recognition or even sensing of the real world, and essentially only has detection to prevent it getting tangled in wires or falling down the stairs. Newer models and more high-end robotic vacuum cleaners, such as the Dyson 360 EYE, use visual imagery to form a map of the room often using something called <a href="SLAM.html">SLAM.</a>
