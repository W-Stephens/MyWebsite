                <p><h4><b>History</b></h4></p>
                <p><br>It wasn’t until recently that autonomous robots have been widely developed. There are several factors that pushed the development of home robotics, including open source software, increased processing powers, and affordable hardware.</p>
                <p><h4><b>Open Source Software</b></h4></p>
                <p><br>Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open source collection of software frameworks that provides operating system-like functionalities. It is developed by the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 2007, and maintained by Willow Garage between 2008 to 2013. The ownership of ROS was then transferred to the Open Source Robotics Foundation.</p>
                <p>According to the CTO of Simbe, a company that manufactured autonomous robots, what would have taken 22 years for a start-up, would now take 18 months, thanks to open source software such as ROS.</p>
                <p><h4><b>Increased Processing Power</b></h4></p>
                <p><br>In the late 1990s, Xerox demonstrated a computer vision system that could track a person’s location from video, even if the person hides behind a pillar. That short video took days to process in the 1990s, and in 2007, took 30 minutes. Steve Cousins, CEO of Willow Garage in 2007, said that “you have to be able to process the data in real time”, and thanks to Moore’s Law, this became a reality in the late 2000s.</p>
                <p>Per Moore’s Law, our processing power will continue to grow exponentially, and with increased processing power, more advanced robots can be developed.</p>
                <p><h4><b>Affordable Hardware</b></h4></p>
                <p><br>In order for home robots to operate, they need to be able to interact and observe its environment. Sensors used to cost thousands of dollars, until the release of Microsoft’s Xbox Kinect in 2010, which was a gaming vision system on sale for hundreds of dollars. In 2015, Intel released their RealSense camera, which is cheaper, and more energy efficient.</p>
