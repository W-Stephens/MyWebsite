                <p>
                  Reaching the World Cup has always been a dream of many a young child in Hong Kong.
                    But in the many years that the national team has been competing in Asian qualifiers,
                    never once have they come close to obtaining any of the berths offered to the continent.
                    Yet in 2015, a new optimism was born in regards to the team. This page documents their
                    qualifying campaign for World Cup 2018 - which did not bring ultimate success, but
                    certainly provided an exciting belief for the future.

                    The team was managed by South Korean Kim Pan-Gon, who had played in Hong Kong during his
                    career and had taken over the national team from 2012.
                    Results leading up to the campaign were less than stellar - an unsuccessful qualifying
                    for the East Asian Championship was followed by scraping a 1-0 against Guam and an
                    unconvincing 0-0 against Malaysia.

                    Support for the team, however, was at an all time high after the Chinese FA created a
                    seemingly racist poster against the Hong Kong team, claiming that a team with players of
                    "black skin, yellow skin, and white skin" was "multi-layered". With the already high tensions
                    between Hong Kong and China, this poster prompted a retaliation by the HKFA to "not be
                    underestimated" - forging the underdog mentality that resonated throughout this 8-game campaign.
                    With all this taking place in the few days leading up to the first match against Bhutan,
                    passionate fans were ready to crowd into the stadium and support the side.

                    Under a full house of 6326 at Mong Kok Stadium, the team put in a strong attacking display to put
                    Bhutan to the sword. Perhaps fitting that players of black, yellow, and white skin all scored,
                    as 6 players combined for 7 goals. The game also saw the beginning of the national anthem being booed
                    before the start of every game - as Hong Kong shares a national anthem with that of China.

                    Five days later, another full house saw witness to Hong Kong put away Maldives 2-0 to continue their
                    qualifying campaign with style. A tougher fought game than the first, it took until midway through the
                    second half for the two goals to come - one from a great team move, the other from an excellent
                    individual free kick. This game saw Hong Kong take an early lead in the table, sitting top of the
                    group with 6 points.

                    Away to China in nearby Shenzhen, the team faced its biggest test yet, but came through with shining
                    colours. In a spirited display, the defence held strong in the face of wave after wave of attack
                    from the clearly superior opposition. The game certainly got heated - and further furore erupted after
                    the game when the Hong Kong goalkeeper Yapp Hung Fai accused the Chinese captain Zheng Zhi of spitting
                    on him at the end of the match. Nevertheless, with this point, Hong Kong continued to sit at the
                    top of the table, with an impressive 0 goals conceded in 3 games.

                    Against probably the best team in the group, Hong Kong saw themselves severely outclassed in this game;
                    at one point falling behind by three goals. However, with the determination and steely spirit that
                    embodied this qualification campaign, the team managed to salvage two late consolation goals, setting up
                    a grandstand finish. This late perofrmance buoyed the team and their morale, bringing in momentum to the
                    next game against Bhutan and pleasing the third full house in a row at Mong Kok Stadium.

                    An 89th minute header from Hong Kong's all time leading scorer Chan Siu Ki scraped the team an away win
                    in this fixture, after a fairly uninspiring performance. Against a team with a very clear defensive structure
                    and an unfamiliar astroturf pitch, the team's resilience was rewarded the three points, but it was overall
                    a performance lacking in creativity and one to forget.

                    For the second qualifier in a row, Hong Kong squeezed their way past a weaker team, this time through a
                    penalty won and converted by debutant Paulinho. The game also saw a lot of new faces into the team,
                    preparing for a huge game at home to China the following week, one where the team would once again have
                    their backs against the wall.

                    In a game where luck swung both ways, the team came out with a very credible 0-0 draw under the roof
                    of a packed Mong Kok Stadium. As opposed to the reverse fixture, Hong Kong had much more attacking
                    potential in this game - hitting the bar and even having a contentious goal disallowed. On the other hand,
                    China will count themselves unlucky to not have scored as well, with one of their strikes seemingly
                    going over the line but not given as a goal. The stage was then set for the final game against Qatar,
                    who were likely to top the group - but Hong Kong still had the slight chance of coming 2nd and qualifying
                    as one of the four-best 2nd place finishers.

                    A valiant display concluded the qualification campaign for the side, going down 2-0 to two very good goals
                    by the opposition. Only trailing by one until the very last minutes, Hong Kong had several good chances
                    on the counter, but were never fully threatening as the gulf in quality showed. Nevertheless, it was
                    a resolute performance from the side and reflective of the incredible campaign that they had, making
                    the city proud one last time.

                    Qatar and a China side that miraculously defeated Qatar in their final game to scrape through as one
                    of the best 2nd-place finishers.

                    In spite of this, the Hong Kong team managed to ignite a passion for the side again, and let people
                    continue to believe in their ultimate dream - making it on the world stage.
