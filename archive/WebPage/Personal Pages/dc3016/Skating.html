                        I only recently picked up skating. It was only when I started Imperial that I began to skate properly.
                        I had skated before; I was pretty interested in it since my cousin played skate hockey and it looked
                        very fun. My cousin bought me some rollerblades for my birthday about three years ago, but I didn't
                        really use them at all. However, this proved to be useful because Imperial has their very own
                        Skating Society, or 'Skate Soc' for short.

                        This takes place every wednesday at 1:00 behind the Royal Albert Hall on a road in front of the Albert
                        Memorial. It is without a doubt, one of my favourite weekly activities. It is incredibly fun and it is
                        a great place to meet new people. In general, there are three different things going on at once. First,
                        there is the opportunity to just skate up and down and practice. Skate Soc provides pairs of skates to
                        those that come without. Secondly, there are the slalom cones. It takes great skill to be able to slalom
                        through the cones without touching them, especially on one foot. Some of the people there are amazing.
                        Finally, my favourite, hockey.

                        The thing I love the most about Skate Soc each week, is the hockey. We have two goals and we place them
                        on the road and we get our sticks and play. I would say I am fairly good at hockey, as I am comfortable
                        on skates and have good reflexes. It can get very competitive and it is good fun. Occasionally we have to
                        stop play for a moment while we let the bikes pass, since it is a road after all. On the rare occasion, a
                        park van or a police car comes down the road and we have to move the goals slightly for them to get past.

                        I currently use Oxelo skates and recently purchased some new wheels to go with them since my old ones were
                        beginning to get worn out. Below are pictures of my skates, and the wheels I am using next to them. The wheels
                        are red and yellow in an alternating pattern.
