        <p> I am currently a first-year computing student at Imperial, expected to graduate in 2020. My page highlights a variety of traditional Hong Kong food, as well as a little side-project Iâ€™m working on.
        <p> I was born and raised in Hong Kong, and grew up in a small community called Discovery Bay.
        <p> My interests outside beyond the course includes Badminton, Basketball, movies, video games, and much more. Below is a link to my CV.
