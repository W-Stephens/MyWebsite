        <p>After doing my first hackathon (IC Hack 2017), I was deeply inspired to begin my own project, and therefore begun on this. Temporarily, I’ve named this project focus (Link to github), as it’s the primary goal of this software. As of today, I’ve made some small progress in the code, and currently working on the database connectivity. </p>
        <p>The application is essentially a platform that sorts out all your work. I hope that it could eventually work as a very basic social media, with leaderboards, scoring and reward systems, providing a virtual incentive to work. </p>
        <p>Each person will be able to add work, and as they complete a task, they are rewarded points, the points can be used to redeem rewards. Currently, the idea of a reward is based off a virtual garden that the player owns. The points can be used to buy new seeds, or the ‘grow’ a plant. The obvious flaw of this system is that the player could add a series of worthless tasks and mark them as completed, a way around this could be allowing all other users to view completed tasks, or if institutions make use of it, then the instructors will set tasks. However, as for now, it will work off a honour system. </p>
